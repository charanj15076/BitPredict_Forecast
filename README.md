# **Title: "Bitcoin Price Forecasting Using N-BEATS Algorithm"**

## **Description**:
This project centered on leveraging the N-BEATS algorithm from a Research paper(https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10437) to forecast Bitcoin prices, offering a robust methodology for predictive analysis in the cryptocurrency market.

## **Key Highlights**:

1. Data Preparation: Historical Bitcoin price data was processed and organized into appropriate input sequences, facilitating the training of the N-BEATS algorithm.
2. N-BEATS Implementation: The project extensively implemented the N-BEATS algorithm, a cutting-edge deep learning architecture designed for time series forecasting tasks.
3. Model Tuning and Training: The N-BEATS model was fine-tuned with customizable parameters such as input size, theta size, number of layers, neurons, and horizon, ensuring optimal       
   performance for Bitcoin price prediction.
4. Performance Evaluation: Rigorous evaluation metrics including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error 
   (MAPE), and Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) were employed to assess the accuracy and robustness of the N-BEATS model.
5. Hyperparameter Optimization: The project explored various hyperparameter configurations to enhance the predictive power of the N-BEATS algorithm, thereby improving its ability to 
   capture complex patterns and trends in Bitcoin price data.
6. Future Price Forecasting: The trained N-BEATS model was utilized to forecast future Bitcoin prices, providing valuable insights into potential market trends and fluctuations.
   Model Comparison: The performance of the N-BEATS algorithm was compared against other machine learning models, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority in cryptocurrency price 
   forecasting.
7. Visualization and Interpretation: Results were visualized through charts and graphs, enabling stakeholders to interpret and understand the forecasted Bitcoin price trends effectively.
   This project showcases the efficacy of the N-BEATS algorithm as a powerful tool for accurate and reliable Bitcoin price forecasting, empowering investors and analysts with valuable 
   insights into cryptocurrency market dynamics and trends.
